Help for {hi:outwrite}
{hline}

{title:Description}

{p}{cmd: outwrite} reads multiple regressions saved with {help estimates store}, consolidates them into a single table, and exports the results to a .xlsx, .xls, .csv, or .tex file.{p_end}
{break}{break} {p}Alternatively, as a programming command, it will accept a single matrix and print that; it will also look for matrix_STARS and affix that number of stars to each cell.{p_end}

{title:Syntax}

{p 2 4 4}{cmd: outwrite} {it:estimates_1} {it:estimates_2} [...]{break}
{help using} "{it:/path/to/output}.[xlsx|xls|csv|tex]" , {break}
[{opt r:eplace} {opt s:tats()} {opth d:rop(varlist)}] {break}
[{opt t:stat}|{opt p:value}] [{opth f:ormat(format)}] {break}

{p 4}{bf:Options}{p_end}
{synopt:}{p_end}
{synopt:{opt r:eplace}}Allows {bf:outwrite} to overwrite the output file.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt s:tats()}}Adds statistics from {help ereturn:e()} at the bottom of the table, such as N, r2, or scalars added by {help estadd}.{p_end}
{synopt:{opth d:rop(varlist)}}Suppresses reporting of all variables in in {help varlist} from the output. This can be a factor variable list.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt t:stat}|{opt p:value}}Reports T-statistics or P-values in regression table, instead of the default standard errors.{p_end}
{synopt:{opth f:ormat(format)}}Format the table values. By default this is %9.2f.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt sheet()}}Place results in a target sheet if using .xlsx format.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt m:odify}}Allows {bf:outwrite} to modify the output file. Often required with {opt sheet()} to work as expected.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt row:names()}}Manually renames rows of output. By default, the rows are named to reflect the variables in the estimation command.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt col:names()}}Manually renames columns of output. By default, the columns are named to reflect the saved equation names.{p_end}
{synoptline}
{p 4 4 4}{it:Note: if used to export a matrix, {opt stats()}, {opt drop()}, and {opt t:stat}|{opt p:value} will not be accepted.}
